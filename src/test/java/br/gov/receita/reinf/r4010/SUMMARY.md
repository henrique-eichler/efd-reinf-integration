# Summary of Implemented Tests

I've implemented comprehensive tests for the r4010 package, including:

## Entity Tests
- Created test classes for all 8 entity classes
- Each test verifies:
  - Builder pattern functionality
  - Getters and setters
  - equals() and hashCode() methods

## Mapper Tests
- Created a test class for the R4010Mapper
- Verifies correct mapping from XML schema objects to entity objects
- Handles complex nested object structures

## Documentation
- Added README.md files explaining the test structure
- Included instructions for running tests
- Documented test coverage

## Organization
- Organized tests in a logical package structure
- Created separate packages for entity and mapper tests
- Added documentation for builder pattern tests

All tests follow JUnit 5 best practices and provide thorough verification of the functionality.
